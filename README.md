Implementation of "Evolved Cellular Automata for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Imitate the Determinants for Folding Observed in Nature" paper
As it is mentioned in the title of the paper, it is about predicting protein secondary structure using cellular automata. Cellular automata use a set of rules to generate the new state. These rules are discovered through artificial intelligence methods, in this case, the genetic algorithm. We took a step further and tried other artificial intelligence algorithms to estimate these rules. Hill climbing, Simulated annealing, Genetic algorithm, Particle swarm optimization, Cuckoo's nest and machine learning.
